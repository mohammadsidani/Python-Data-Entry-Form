# Python-Data-Entry-Form
Data entry form using Python as GUI and MySQL as Database where I used MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE and pymysql to connect the database with the application. First, download MySQL installer from <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/"> here </a> then install MySQL Workbench and Python Connector.
